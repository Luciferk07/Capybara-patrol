Editorial: Capybara Placement Problem
Problem Statement
Given an n×m grid where some cells contain capybaras ('C') and others are empty ('.'), count how many empty cells can accommodate a new capybara such that it shares at least one row or column with an existing capybara.

Mathematical Formulation
Let:

$G$ be the n×m grid where $G_{ij} \in {'.', 'C'}$

$R = {i | \exists j \text{ s.t. } G_{ij} = 'C'}$ (rows with capybaras)

$C = {j | \exists i \text{ s.t. } G_{ij} = 'C'}$ (columns with capybaras)

The solution is the cardinality of the set:
S
=
{
(
i
,
j
)
∣
G
i
j
=
′
.
′
 and 
(
i
∈
R
 or 
j
∈
C
)
}
S={(i,j)∣G 
ij
​
 = 
′
 . 
′
  and (i∈R or j∈C)}

Solution Approach
Key Insight
A new capybara at position (i,j) will have at least one friend if:

There exists another capybara in row i, OR

There exists another capybara in column j

Optimal Algorithm
Preprocessing:

Identify all rows containing at least one capybara ($R$)

Identify all columns containing at least one capybara ($C$)

Counting Valid Positions:
For each empty cell (i,j):

If i ∈ R or j ∈ C → valid position

Else → invalid position

Complexity Analysis
Time Complexity: $O(n \times m)$

One pass to identify R and C

One pass to count valid positions

Space Complexity: $O(n + m)$

Storage for row and column markers

Solution Code
cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    
    int n, m;
    cin >> n >> m;
    
    vector<string> grid(n);
    vector<bool> row_has_c(n, false);
    vector<bool> col_has_c(m, false);
    
    // First pass: Identify rows and columns with capybaras
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> grid[i];
        for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
            if (grid[i][j] == 'C') {
                row_has_c[i] = true;
                col_has_c[j] = true;
            }
        }
    }
    
    int count = 0;
    
    // Second pass: Count valid positions
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
            if (grid[i][j] == '.' && (row_has_c[i] || col_has_c[j])) {
                count++;
            }
        }
    }
    
    cout << count << "\n";
    
    return 0;
}
Proof of Correctness
Lemma 1: The algorithm correctly identifies all rows and columns containing capybaras.
Proof: By examining every cell exactly once during the first pass, we accurately mark all rows and columns that contain at least one 'C'.

Lemma 2: A position (i,j) is counted if and only if it satisfies the friendship condition.
Proof:

(⇒) If counted, then either row i or column j has a capybara by construction.

(⇐) If (i,j) has a capybara in its row or column, the algorithm will detect this through row_has_c[i] or col_has_c[j].

Theorem: The algorithm correctly solves the problem in O(n×m) time.
Proof: Follows directly from Lemmas 1 and 2, with the complexity analysis showing optimal time and space usage.

Example Walkthrough
Input:

3 3
C..
...
..C
Processing:

Identify:

Rows with capybaras: R = {0, 2}

Columns with capybaras: C = {0, 2}

Count valid empty cells:

(0,1), (0,2) - same row as (0,0)

(1,0), (1,2) - same columns as existing capybaras

(2,0), (2,1) - same row as (2,2)

Output: 6

Optimizations
Early Termination: If all rows or all columns contain capybaras, all empty cells are valid.

Bitmask Representation: For very large n,m, rows/columns could be represented as bitsets.

Parallel Processing: The counting pass can be parallelized since cell checks are independent.

Conclusion
This problem demonstrates how careful preprocessing can lead to an optimal solution. By first identifying the critical rows and columns, we reduce the subsequent checking to simple boolean operations, resulting in an efficient O(n×m) algorithm that is both easy to understand and implement.
